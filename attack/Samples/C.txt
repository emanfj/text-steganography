3. The Train Station
A flurry of activity filled the grand train station. People hurried to and fro, their suitcases clattering across the polished marble floors with a rhythmic clatter. Announcements crackled through the loudspeakers, their monotone voices blending with the excited chatter of travelers. Children chased each other through the waiting areas, their laughter a joyous counterpoint to the rhythmic chugging of an arriving train. Steam billowed from its funnel, painting wispy patterns in the air, a nostalgic scene from a by-gone era.
