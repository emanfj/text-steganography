1. The Old Toy Box
Dust motes danced in the sliver of light that peeked through the dusty attic window. Forgotten treasures lay buried beneath layers of faded fabric. A chipped porcelain doll stared blankly from the bottom, her once vibrant dress now pale and limp. A rusty tin car lay crumpled in the  corner, its chipped paint a reminder of countless adventures. A tattered teddy bear, missing an eye and one ear, held its ground in the center of the box, a silent testament to years of love and cuddles. The smell of mothballs hung heavy in the air,  a bittersweet fragrance of childhood memories.
