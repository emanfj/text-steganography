1) Just going over the peices of text
   > Spotted a double space in A.txt ("...in the  corner, its chipped...")
   > Spotted another double space in A.txt ("...heavy in the air,  a bittersweet...")
   
   > B.txt also started with a "1" not "2" Maybe it has some meaning
   > End with a few newlines (or some other special chars)
   > It also ends with a "1." and few more new lines ("\n") chars

   > C.txt didnt seem to have any annomaly

   > D.txt starts with "1" instead of "4" (strong indecation that this number has some meaning)
   > It also ends with a few newlines

   > E.txt starts with "1" instead of "5" (this also might just be a formatting error by Eman)
   > It also had some format written in brackets such as "(italic)" or "(underline)"

2) Further Analysis
   > I opened each file in Notepad++ where you can make special chars like tabs, spaces and newlines visible
      - Found that document B, D and E have a lot of very strange chars between each symbol
      - Conclusion: 
         - They must be the texts with hidden info
         - They also all start with a 1... Weird

3) Getting the msg
   > On the bottom left of both notepad and notepad++ we can see what character-encoding is used
      - UTF-8 is being used
   > Using this website https://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/utf-8.cgi?input=%E2%80%8C&mode=char I got the name of the special chars
      - Zero width non-joiner (zwnj)
      - Zero width joiner (zwj)
   > Only these two special chars can be seen being used
      - Binary perhaps
   > Created a short program to read every byte to see patterns
   > Extracted out the byte for secret text (i considered zwnj as 0 and zwj as 1)
      - This output was p much garbage
      - The out put was, however, very far from alphabetical
         - This implies that a XOR has happened at some point
   > Wrote a code to try out XOR with many different keys (BRUTE FORCE)
      - Found that some keys (in range 64 to 127) produce more alphabetical sequences
