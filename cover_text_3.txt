1. The Bakery Window
Golden light streamed through the bakery window, illuminating a world of delectable delights. Crusty baguettes lay stacked neatly on a wicker basket, releasing a warm, yeasty aroma that filled the air. Croissants shimmered, their flaky layers begging to be devoured. Delicate pastries, adorned with glistening fruit, were displayed like miniature works of art on a tiered stand(italic). A young girl pressed her nose against the glass, her eyes wide with wonder, her mind already planning her sweet treat for after school.
