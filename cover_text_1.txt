1. The Park Bench
The park bench creaked softly as the old woman settled onto its worn wooden surface. Pigeons cooed nearby, their grey feathers catching the afternoon sun in a soft glimmer. She closed her eyes, inhaling the sweet scent of freshly cut grass and blooming flowers. Wrinkled hands clutched a worn leather handbag, memories tucked away within like pressed wildflowers. A lifetime of stories rested in the lines etched deeply around her eyes, waiting to be unfolded.
